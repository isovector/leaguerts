# League

I wrote this in 2007. It's an engine clone of Warcraft 3.

## Project Description
An RTS game engine written entirely in XNA. Designed to provide an interface
similar to that of Blizzard games, and the internal workings are much the same.
Currently supports units, buildings, abilities, a scripting engine, maps, custom
resources and more.
